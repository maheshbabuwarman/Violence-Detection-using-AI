# Violence-Detection-using-AI

The purpose of this system is to replace the traditional 
way of security where there is a need for many security guards, 
expensive costs of hiring security guards, and a lack of discipline 
among the guards. Whenever an anomaly action happens, the 
system will detect it and triggers an alarm sound, alerting the 
person in charge in the surveillance room. An AI model, namely 
Convolutional LSTM model is built and detect whether the action 
in a certain area is considered a violent action or not.

Model used: ConvLSTM
